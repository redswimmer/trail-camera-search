# Trail Camera Image and Video Search with Meta AI ImageBind
This project demonstrates how to build multi-modal search (image and video) using the [Meta AI ImageBind](https://imagebind.metademolab.com/) and [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) vector database.

Querying using one modality (e.g. text) will include results in all available modalities (e.g. images and video), as all objects will be encoded into a single vector space.

## Note: Docker image requiredss 12GB so update WSL config
